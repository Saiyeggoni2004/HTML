
Certainly, here are some examples drawn from the sources regarding HTML audio and video tags:

*   **Supported Media Formats**:
    *   For **audio**, formats like **MP3** are supported.
    *   For **video**, formats such as **MP4** are supported.

*   **Attributes for the `<audio>` tag**:
    *   `controls`: This attribute provides playback controls such as a **play button, mute button, and progress bar**.
    *   `loop`: When this attribute is present, the audio will **play repeatedly** from the beginning once it finishes.
    *   `autoplay`: This attribute causes the audio to **start playing automatically** as soon as it is ready.
    *   `muted`: If this attribute is used, the audio will be **muted by default** when it starts playing.

*   **Attributes for the `<video>` tag**:
    *   `src`: This attribute is used to specify the **path to the video file**.
    *   `controls`: Similar to the audio tag, this attribute adds **playback controls** (like play, pause, volume, and fullscreen) to the video player.
    *   `loop`: This attribute makes the video **play continuously in a loop**.
    *   `autoplay`: This attribute allows the video to **start playing automatically**.
    *   `muted`: This attribute **mutes the video's audio by default** when it loads.
    *   `poster`: This attribute allows you to **display an image** over the video before it starts playing.

*   **Basic Syntax Examples**:
    *   **Audio Tag Syntax**: `<audio controls src="path/to/audio.mp3"></audio>`. Here, "path/to/audio.mp3" is an example of the **audio file's path**.
    *   **Video Tag Syntax**: `<video controls src="path/to/video.mp4"></video>`. Similarly, "path/to/video.mp4" is an example of the **video file's path**.
