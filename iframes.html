The `<iframe>` tag in HTML is used to **embed another HTML document within the current HTML document**. This allows you to display content from other sources directly on your webpage.

Here are some examples of what you can embed or display using the `<iframe>` tag:

*   **Embedding YouTube Videos**: You can embed YouTube videos into your webpage. This is a common use case for the `<iframe>` tag to display online videos. To do this, you would typically use the `src` attribute to point to the YouTube video's embed URL. For example, a YouTube video's embed code would be copied and pasted into your HTML using the `<iframe>` tag. This allows the video to play directly on your website.
*   **Displaying Other Webpages**: You can display any webpage from the internet within your HTML file using the `<iframe>` tag. This means you can show content from another website directly on your own page.
    *   **Specifying Dimensions**: When embedding a webpage, you can control its size using the `width` and `height` attributes. These can be set in pixels. For instance, you could set `width="500"` and `height="300"` to specify the frame's dimensions.
    *   **Controlling Borders**: The `frameborder` attribute can be used to add or remove a border around the `<iframe>`. Setting `frameborder="0"` will remove the border.
    *   **Managing Scrolling**: The `scrolling` attribute allows you to manage scrollbars for the embedded content.
        *   `scrolling="yes"` ensures scrollbars are always present.
        *   `scrolling="no"` prevents scrollbars from appearing.
        *   `scrolling="auto"` (the default) allows the browser to automatically decide whether scrollbars are needed based on the content size. If the content fits within the specified `width` and `height`, scrollbars won't appear; otherwise, they will.
*   **Embedding PDF Documents**: You can also embed PDF documents into your webpage. Similar to embedding a webpage, you would use the `src` attribute to specify the location of the PDF file. When a PDF document is embedded, it may display options like download and print directly within the frame.

The `<iframe>` tag essentially acts like a window, allowing you to display external content – whether it's a video, another website, or a document – directly within your current HTML page.
